This addon keeps track the contents of your ebox on CatseyeXi for Crystal Warriors.

Each time you check or put something into ebox, the count tracking each item will be updated.
The amount won't be subtracted from it due to the limitations I know how to deal with (just an ambiguous you obtain message)
if you access or put anything into the box then it will update with the correct amount again.

It's mostly useful as an audit of what you have.  If you withdraw everything you can check it again with an !box command or put some back in and it will update.

If you have never accessed an item in the ebox it won't know how many you have

To install, copy the boxebox folder into your addons folder

Usage:
load addon:
/addon load boxebox
